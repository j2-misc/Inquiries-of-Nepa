# Notes
The party split to attack the ships and the outpost simultaneously. Chaos ensued. Afterwards, the party regrouped in the northwest by a sparkling-scaled blue dragon, the only captive at the rear encampment. Spines hovered above the curve of its back and it apologized, “Excuse me if my looks are improper for our first meeting. Thank you for the assistance.” They suggested taking care of the ships from then, and Hearth informed them it’d already been taken care of.

Then, they made their way to the forward encampment on the way back to the Saxe fort.
