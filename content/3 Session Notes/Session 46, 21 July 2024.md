# Notes
The party approached the Saxe Fort. They were thanked for their service, offered to stay the night, have their ship repaired, and invited to dinner. They noticed the faint blue glow emanating between the cracks of the steel plates that made up the azure legionnaires, where metal overlapped hardened wood. Some had jaws, some didn’t, some had paint, others wore fabrics, all blue. The one they stood before had a streak on their pauldron as well as a fabric tied around their thigh. It led them through a hallway and mouthlessly spoke, “These are your rooms, all are available, pick as you wish.” Afterwards, he asked if they’d like it to fetch the rest of the party, they said yes, and its head moved into a relaxed position.

The room was a military bunk with two beds, one on the far end, one closer. Both had chests at their feet. There wasn’t much in the way of stylings, and as they entered the room, the floor was dusty. Anasa then cast druidcraft for the first time to predict the weather within the next twenty-four hours. To the north-north west there was a storm with bits of glittering pink. Lo then coached Anasa and Hearth on table manners, as Anasa had raised prior concerns.

Pradesh, meanwhile, talked with their new rescuee. They asked how long they’d been at sea, and he answered that they’d only been at it for about five days or so. They talked some more about Yamanu as well. When they arrived, they saw two legionnaires guarding the ship, as well as the obsidian-skinned Yamanu on the top deck. Wielding an umbrella, they smiled wide, “Kal! You made it!”

Kal, the marble-skinned individual, seemed a little less enthusiastic, but was still happy to see them. Their old ship was certainly sunk by now which Kal was sad about because he still had some candy on there. “Do you remember what I asked you to do?” Yamanu asked

“Uh… … … yeah! I was supposed to investigate the akumatoa”

“Kuo-toa.”  
“Kuo-toa! And find their murals.”

“That’s right, bud.”

There were also three more siblings left to find: Casey, ??, and Enid (supposedly easy to find, blue). They explained they all had a unique series of abilities, and Yamanu demonstrated by throwing his umbrella at Kal who smashed it to pieces as a reaction. Yamanu lacked super strength, but had the power of illusion magic. They were investigating the region because they thought it might tell them something about themselves, and why they were the way they were.

They weren’t really related by blood, but they were all abandoned by their birth parents, who couldn’t stand their appearances or abilities. While wondering about what they’d have to eat, the legionnaires snapped to attention and invited the crew of the Twilight Wanderer to the Saxe Fort.

Eventually, dinner was served.

They were seated at a long elliptical table, at the end of which was Governor Bence Numitor wearing a different toga than he had been previously, with a scaled pattern toward its edges, coalescing in a swirled pattern near the chest. Yamanu mentioned to a legionnaire that he’d be taking his dinner upstairs as he had important work to complete.

“I would once again like to extend my sincerest gratitude for your efforts. You did more than I asked for and excelled where others had failed. You accomplished a difficult feat. I also received word from the Kuo-Toa that you kept damage to their Ziggurat to a minimum. But I must ask, what has driven you all the way out here?”

Lo answered they were here to find a crown on behalf of the Coalition of Waquo, and then Numitor asked where the rest of the party hailed from. They all hailed from different parts of the continent of Roabi. Everyone else felt the food was very well seasoned, but Lo’s appetizer was a little spicier than expected. Anasa and Hearth noticed that the governor also had a bit of difficulty handling the meal. It was a grilled scaleshade, a plant that grew exclusively on Avis Isle. There was a tree there which grew large leaf-like fruits which are sometimes used in herbal remedies.

The mutants were apparently leading a full-scale assault at Avis Isle, home to the legion’s most senior governor. “While I’m confident in their ability, I don’t think the odds are stacked in their favor, which is troubling. If you do encounter the governor there, give them my best regards. I would go myself, but we still have a lot to do here.”

Hearth mentioned they met at the Roil Rumble, which the Governor knew about. Lo questioned him on his knowledge of the outside world, and the secrecy of the legion within the Ifig Region. “We like to keep it that way. We really only cover an area comparable to the space between Wayro and Gulay.” The increased traffic to the region was somewhat of a concern to Numitor (though not all the governors) for this reason. He also mentioned that he’d only been a governor for about two years, but the legion had existed for roughly a century.

The second course, the entree was served, a large assortment of seafood in a rich garlic sauce. The star attraction, though, was a giant crab (like a statblock, size:large crab). The Governor complimented the party on their industriousness, having been productive in the five days they’d been sailing through the Ifig Region. He said it upset him that some people would refuse to act even when action was necessary.

Dessert, tiramisu and espresso for those who wanted it, was served. Anasa and Hearth both tried the espresso, and both hated it but tried to pretend they didn’t. Afterwards, they were presented with a plate with five cerulean cups and a fine blue marble. The Governor then asked the party if they’d indulge him in a game, the shell game. Currently, no one had ever guessed more than five times in a row. For some reason, Lo could use her arcana instead of perception for this game.

During the game, Anasa commented that it was like hunting prey, and the Governor agreed. When Hearth failed the third round, the Governor commented he’d be tied with two of the other governors, including Nicola. Anasa failed the fourth round, and the Governor commented that even the Governor of Avis Isle had difficulty then.

After dinner, the party was rewarded for their efforts.
- Pot of Awakening
- Decanter of Endless Water
- Helm of Telepathy
- Bag of Holding
- Cloak of the Manta Ray

They talked a bit about how everyone except Anasa and Lo had been cursed by this witch Eeriweth. Lo prayed at the sea for this.

Lo heard a message as she prepared for sleep to take her, “Subject p… almost certain… she is the… positive of it… awaiting fur-... -tions…” Then she donned her helm of telepathy. She immediately felt a connection, then more, and suddenly she felt that just at the edge of her fingertips there was a web of different nodes; available points for her telepathy to reach. There were some larger than other, and one even took her miles away. She connected to the closest large node, hearing the Governor, “Well I suppose that settles that matter. Hopefully they’ll be able to help Villanueva. I’ll keep a close eye on them. But I’m almost certain I’m right about her. She was affected by the poison, she heard the signal, and I’m almost certain she can hear us.”

She experimented with the nodes more, and found that the smaller nodes, the Azure Legionnaires, would immediately relay information to all of those to whom they were connected. There seemed to also be relays that would connect to nodes far far away, further than typical magic would allow. It was a cascade of information through a node graph. The legionnaires alerted the party and they grouped up. Hearth magically surveyed the area and got the sense it was a false alarm. Looking at the nodes, Lo saw them all talk amongst each other, then finally to the big node (but not the relay). Then after a few minutes, the order to stand down began cascading from the large node, Numitor.

Hearth quietly told the others that over twenty soldiers were protecting their ship, which seemed a little overkill. Back in the rooms, where everyone had doubled up just in case, Lo tested the Bag of Holding. She noticed the closest small node was now connected to the Governor. But she found that when she was inside the Bag of Holding, she couldn’t see the nodes; the equivalent of a 404 error.

The next morning, they had breakfast and Hearth cast primal inheritance to learn of the Deinonychus.
