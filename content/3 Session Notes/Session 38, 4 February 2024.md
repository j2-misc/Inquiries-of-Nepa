# Notes
[[Anasa]] looked to some movement in the brush, and [[Asunur]] struck! Anasa was hit and tried to retaliate, but the [[Oni]] soon vanished and fled. Anasa reunited with [[Hearth]] and [[Lo]], and they made plans for what to do. [[Kohgar]] was the next target.

Lured away by some jerky, he was attacked out of the darkness by the Oni! [[Pradesh]] ran to his defense, and then they regrouped with the rest of the party when it fled again. 

Kohgar then led the party, following its scent to the shack. An overhead swinging axe trap hit Lo when she kicked open the door. It seemed like a farming shack though it lacked most of the tools for the trade. Lo found that the center panel of the shack was a trapdoor, and she found the groove, opening it. It was pretty dim further down, but after a twenty-five foot drop was a bed of moss. Lo secured a rope for the climb back up, then hopped down.

The moss was comfortable and a candle was nearby, but it began to mix with the blood draining from the blood of orcish humanoids. Lo noted the candle was lit, and Anasa discerned it was lit for about five hours. They thought on what this could mean and Lo noted the presence of conjuration magic on the corpses. Both investigated and each saw these arboreal limbs climbing out of the corpses like water. [[Lampads]]. They managed to kill one with the help of the others, and force the other to retreat.

Hearth and Pradesh heard some gentle humming in a silky language emanating from the door on the other end of the hallway. Anasa listened in to the [[Sylvan]], discerning it as a song of delightful war. Lo opened the door to the next room. It was a mockery of a living room, most of the furniture made of varnished bone with some bits of flayed green skin. There was an oni sitting in a chair, and the party was quick to attack, but it cast some darkness over the area, and vanished. It bore no injuries, and the party then noted the presence of two chairs. This was a second monster.

Past a narrow tunnel formed of a crack in the wall was an underground river, bloated corpses standing sentry. Across the way was a workroom filled with torture devices, and more dead. He doused his glaive in a liquid like the one they saw in the previous room. The party slew the oni and the lampads that accompanied it, then leaving. Lo informed Rulfim and ensured that her crew didn't squat overnight in a farm.

*Though still...
      ... there might still be another oni.*
