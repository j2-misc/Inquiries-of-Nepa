# Notes
Lo touched the blue orb next to her and it was cool to the touch but was otherwise uninteresting. After a short rest, the mural on the wall began to move. The clouds parted and a beam of light shone down, and at the center of the surrounding masses, a ziggurat began to rise before it reset.

On the floor above there was a light blue glow from the floor, and these golden orbs permeating the room. There was a set of rope seemingly binding someone to the other side of a central column. They started fighting, and during the fight a humanoid cephalopod emerged from behind the column. Hearth managed to round the column and investigate the captive, and found a marble-skinned person with black crusty bits and pinkish eyes, "Oh hey," he said. Eventually, they killed all the guys and rescued the one guy and Anasa collected several vials of the celestial essences around for her scavenger hunt.

Their rescuee also pointed them to the other murals. Another mural on the second floor saw a gray sky and a calm sea, rubble and ruins, humanoid and fishfolk bodies floating in the water. What few fishfolk remained standing appeared listless.

Another saw a roiling tempest in the sky with purple and red clouds. Beneath the waves was a collection of fishfolk, screaming with eyes bulging from their heads

The northernmost mural saw a tower rise in the background before a purple wave fell out of it while in the foreground fishfolk carried baskets.

There were no animated murals on the first floor. Their guest also showed them a secret exit in the armory on the first floor. Beneath which was a dark, watery pit.
## *They followed the underwater tunnel...*
It was inordinately long, twisty and turn-y. They stumbled to the left of a branch and ended up in a large circular chamber with one big passage down the middle. There, they were immediately confronted by two Kuo-toa who raised their tridents at the party. The guards called back and a voice from deeper in beckoned
them in, "let them pass." They stepped through onto seaweed and there was a number of Kuo-toa forming an audience chamber, at the end of which was one with an intricate headdress, and to either side there were benches, and to the right was a half-elven woman with a mask covering her mouth dressed in a religious robe. They recognized her as Fio, the mage of the Bloody Sails.

The Kuo-toa matriarch raised her staff in the air and spoke, "Why are you here?"

The party said they were there on behalf of the legion and they could prove they weren't traitorous. The Kuo-toa asked to perform a Laglacglu, a ritual to determine what really did happen. They had half a glathu to prepare.

Evidence
1. Weregull feather sample
2. Azure Legion armory, no piercing weapons
3. Distant picture of weregull circling Ziggurat
4. Golden orbs untouched
5. Azure Legion soldier's body found in the Ziggurat
6. Witness testimony from marble fellow
7. Anasa autopsy of octowere

They prepared their arguments, and emerged to take position at their bench. They saw Fio without her mask. This time, different from the Rumble, her mouth extended to the edges of her cheeks like a snake.
## OPENING STATEMENTS
*Fio*
"Oh gathered, I present myself humbly before you today to discuss the traitorous attack by the Azure Legion which happened in the dead of night while all were sound asleep. They came, organized, brutal, attacking the temple, forcing you all to flee. Who else could have done it? No other armed forces on the island exist, and only the azure legion possess the ability to be so organized to attack so brutally. High Priestess, the answer is clear."

*Party, Hearth*
"High Priestess, gathered Kuo-toa. I'd first and foremost like to offer my sincerest condolences for the brutal attack propagated against you. As a victim of a similar event myself I truly sympathize. I'd also like to offer the testimony of someone who suffered the same attack by the mutants, brought here by the Bloody Sails
"If you would allow one of my friends to bring the witness here, we can clear this whole thing up. If that is not allowed, we have many more pieces of evidence to prove the truth."

*Fio*
Told the Kuo-toa not to allow the party to leave, as they would tell the legion of the secret cove's location. Then, the High Priestess told the party to prove their claims first and then *maybe* one would be let go.

*Party*
Lo presented the weregull feathers, and Hearth said that the mutants were the true culprits of their attacks. He mentioned the damage was piercing.

*Fio*
Called into question that the feathers were mutant feathers rather than weregull.

*Party*
Lo drew attention to the base of the weregull feathers where they had hair, evidencing the existence of mutants.

*Fio*
"Even if there were mutants, could we prove they would be so organized to attack in the middle of the night"

*Party*
Brought up the picture was taken at night, and the autopsy of the octowere when Fio tried to counter that the mutants couldn't have been smart enough to organize at such a capacity. They also brought up the dead legion soldier and Hearth turned up the pressure on Fio!

*Fio*
Suggested the Legion wanted to steal magical items from the Kuo-toa, and that they ransacked the temple

*Party*
Lo brought up the in-tact golden orbs! They were storage for magical items, and they were unharmed!

*Fio*
Tried to counter that the legion armed the mutants, but Lo countered with the lack of piercing weapons in the full legion armory! At this point, Fio realized things weren't going her way as the High Priestess looked at her with ire. Fio then held a diminutive Kohgar as a hostage! Anasa tried to rush in to attack, but she teleported away in flame! Though she left a strange lump behind. Hearth unburied Kohgar from the soot, and he was fine.

*Then...*
The High Priestess thanked them for exposing the truth. She asked one final question: "Is it safe to return home?"
"All signs point to yes."
