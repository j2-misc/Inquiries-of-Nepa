# Notes
Once Yamanu was situated, Lo asked them for their initial assessment. "It seems like a doomed operation from the start. So as far as I can tell, it looks like it was a set-up. That whole vault thing? Seems doomed to fail. Why it's at the bottom of the ocean, that I can't tell you."

Pradesh asked them what food they liked to eat, anything in particular around Maz's Island. They recommended Siren Hair, a seagrass grown by the Locathah. They certainly had some to spare, most of it just went to the Azure Legion, anyways. Good in soup, good to make broth from. The yellow was faintly savory; red, sweet. He bought a bundle of each.
## *They set sail for Vaton's Bay...*
8 hours into the journey, Kohgar sensed something. Hearth dove overboard and changed shape to get an eye on the thing buffeting the ship, Lo sent Yamanu below deck to keep an eye on the interior hull. Hearth then saw that it was a large turtle-like creature, headbutting the ship. Not damaging it quite yet, but headbutting it. He tried to get its attention, and it bit him. Then they all saw it breach, following Hearth. It spoke in draconic, then aquan. Something no one on the ship understood, but could roughly be translated as a request to stop and pay a toll for safe passage.

Thankfully, Lo at least knew that Dragon Turtles like this were said to be the offspring of Tratoh, one of Waquo's two children. This was bad, but they were not unreasonable creatures. She had the crew drop anchor and raise the sails, while she went below deck to find a suitable offering. Kohgar dove in to bite away the smaller creatures around it, a cleaning. After Lo sacrificed half the crew's funds to the Dragon Turtle, Anasa recalled she could speak primordial and was able to confirm they were good. As it parted it told to Kohgar, "I await the day you grow to an inch of my stature, Raghok."

Hearth, previously cowering in the shadow of the ship, contemplating what might happen if he lost a limb in wild shape and returned to his true form. He turned out fine, and climbed back aboard, having Pradesh help him bring Kohgar back on board. Hearth then reported to the others that the dragon turtle seemed to know Kohgar and referred to him as Raghok.

*They traveled through the night...*
And in the morning, it was storming, the wind pushing them ahead. Lo gave her navy coat to Anasa, as Yamanu had a poncho. Then Lo had Yamanu wake Pradesh to make breakfast, whereupon he served what was effectively a miso soup. Delicious, warming, perfect for the weather. Hearth cast *water breathing* on everyone, and then cast *primal inheritance* with one of the amethysts they found the day prior in the dungeon.

Hearth attuned himself to the surrounding nature and couldn't help but feel that something was just a bit off.

Lo asked the crew if they had any good stories from home. Hearth told this story of a younger brother named Koni, who sought to become a great hunter out of jealousy for his brother, but in the end made peace with nature and became something even greater.
## *During the story...*
Lo felt her attention pulled elsewhere. Or rather, something seeped its way in. At first it sounded like static, far away, but it began to come through. A broken up message requesting immediate assistance, but she couldn't gather who needed help or where. Lo had Anasa sit up on the crow's nest to keep an eye out. Afterwards, Hearth went up and sat with her.

Anasa reflected on how the story mirrored her own experiences, though she lacked any understanding of the heart of the forest. Hearth told her that she was doing well, and that she'd grown a lot.
## *Finally...*
Anasa spotted a crescent shaped inlet. A bay, beckoning forth. As they approached the beach, they saw many of the trees fell into a mushy ash. There was a blue fort, damaged but still standing. They docked and disembarked. They were greeted by some members of the Azure Legion who informed them there was no treasure to be found here, and that they should evacuate, as the island had been under siege recently. Then there was a rumbling and, the Red Surf, a familiar pirate ship emerged from invisibility. There, a woman with a black mask covering the lower half of her face, came into view. Strange, bulbous-eyed fish creatures accompanied her. Then, emerging from the waves was a cerulean, seafoam green creature which punched straight out of the ocean.

Then, the gargantuan monster flew toward the party. The Legion's guns helped ward off the monster, after it did some damage. The Legionaries explained they used to have a treaty with the denizens here, but the full explanation would be best given by the governor, currently resided at the blue fort in the distance.

Kohgar, meanwhile, had stolen away to try and catch up to the invisible pirate ship. He managed to land atop the Red Surf, where he saw many of the Bloody Sails. The archer, the warrior, and the warlock. She had lines which extended past her lips under her mask, and a forked tongue when she spoke.
They wondered aloud what to do, and the warrior suggested they ask the captain. The captain made herself present, "Oh. It seems they've sent their pet after us. Throw it in the brig."

On the bay, the party decided to speak with the Governor, *then* they would search for Kohgar. Hearth seemed particularly rattled.

Then they met the Governor. A thin man, with shoulder-length brown hair. He was dressed in a celestial blue toga, decadence betrayed only by the clang of his footsteps. A tangled mess of a tattoo dove from his clavicle beneath his cloak. Governor Bence Numetor. The party struck a deal with him to deal with the Kuo-Toa problem (convince them it wasn't the Azure Legion who kicked them out of their temple) and in exchange.

Five days ago, the Kuo-Toa filed a diplomatic complaint, having been removed from their home by some third faction. The Legion sent an adventurer, Kal, to investigate with a Legionare, but they hadn't returned. Three days ago, the pirates arrived and made the Kuo-Toa rituals more elaborate and dangerous. They would be rewarded upon finishing the quest. They were provided a segmentation matrix, a magical orb that provided bits of evidence when twisted. They had three: 1) white feathers, 2) an armory with only slashing weapons, and 3) a picture of a bird-person hybrid, like a weird freaky guy. Also, Pradesh asked about the canons the legion had and was told they might receive one upon quest completion.
## *After...*
They would head east to the Kuo-Toas' former temple. As they wandered east, Lo heard again the same sort of fragmented message in her mind. "She's here --- advise --- [[Azure Commander]]" and that was all she could make out.

Anasa asked Lo if perhaps they could go more directly after the pirates as Hearth was still rattled, but she said they only had this one lead. From the temple, they could find the Kuo-Toa, from them, the pirates, and there, they'd find Kohgar. Pradesh comforted Hearth, and he became more responsive.
