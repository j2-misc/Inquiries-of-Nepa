# Notes
They were faced with a [[Nicola Favianus|halfling woman]] with sunkissed skin and brown hair, wearing simple sailor's clothing. A sapphire blue and stark white gauntlet denoted her rank. She asked why the party was here, and Lo told her truthfully they were there for treasure. She told her that there was none and that she'd told the last three ships the same thing. Lo saw them that what she thought was silver was a pile that seemed to shift and move as though it were alive. Lo asked her if she'd seen the crown they were looking for--the black rhombuses held together by a thin metal band. She hadn't, but suggested one of the other governors might've.

She then introduced them to the concepts of governors and the [[Azure Legion]]. They would be allowed to anchor for the night, if they helped with something. Apparently there were two brigantines approaching. Mutants. Lo asked if they were some of the creatures they saw earlier, but that was a [[Koalinth|Coalinth]]. Regardless, the mutants would be here within the hour, so Lo decided to examine the ship and ensure it was combat ready while the others were permitted to do whatever they wanted.

Kohgar and Hearth played in the water and Kohgar tried to stop Anasa when she tried to cut off some coral from a piece of the reef far below them. Anasa searched for some elsewhere, all for the better as the reef she was trying to harvest from seemed to be cultivated intentionally, likely by the nearby aquatic villagers. She saw some fishlike humanoids--for a brief moment an obsidian thing--but mostly fish people. She then collected four pounds of [[Trenchglow Coral]].
## *The crew all returned to the ship as the hour drew near...*
As did the brigantines. The mutant ships attacked, and so did the party! For a brief bit, Kohgar and Hearth boarded and were bitten by the mutants, and when the fight was over and the enemy ships sunk, the [[Nicola Favianus|Governor]] asked if Kohgar had gotten cursed from it. He didn't seem any more cursed than normal.

Then, she recommended aiding [[Yamanu]], an obsidian figure spending most of their time with the [[Locathah]].
