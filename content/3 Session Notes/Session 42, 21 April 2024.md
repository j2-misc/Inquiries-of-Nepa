# Notes
Lo examined the cloak she found with the first audio log. It was a dark blue exterior, with a hood and two flaps that fell to the front. The interior was a sort of pale gray color, and inside had places to put one's hands. She donned it, and found it was a *Cloak of the Manta Ray*. Then they split up to cover more ground. Anasa and Hearth went down a hole; Lo and Pradesh, down the stairs in the room which used to have golems.
## *Anasa and Hearth...*
They saw tables and broken cutlery. Underneath a broken cask of wine, Anasa caught the blue glint of another audio crystal.  “Kraek! Waquo has abandoned us, damned fiends are starting to spawn from the barrels of water in the kitchen. The wine is turning brackish and Goskol’s blood has turned an odious purple. We can’t keep this up much longer…I’ll have to hide these behind the door that leads to the first floor in the kitchen…”

They navigated around through the darkness and found their way to two sets of stairs leading back up (to rooms 7 and 9). Then they found some strange mutated fish-men, and attacked.
## *Lo and Pradesh...*
Found an area of accursed, poisonous water. Kohgar cleared out the haze, revealing a skeleton with an audiolog crystal and a stone tablet clutched in its hands.  “*hacking cough* Damn Oreleus… you said that thing wouldn’t escape… *cough cough* but you never said anything about its disease starting to leak through the ground… maybe you we’re counting on that… is that why you gave me this damned hacking *cough* I need my things…” The tablet didn't seem any worse for wear, and it depicted a nicely engraved border with a figure sitting on a throne with a large crown on their head. Their feet were tied together with some sort of barbed rope or wire.

The crown seemed to be the same pointed rhombus crown the party was looking for. Or, it was the same shape, but it seemed to be on top of a regular crown, as if the figure was wearing two. This room was definitely an arcane laboratory. There were clay golems, or pieces of them, trapped by the rubble. The room was clear, and they took a sample of the strange magical poison for later examination or use.
## *Anasa and Hearth...*
Killed the sea spawn and collected a necklace that one of them was wearing. Upon examination, Hearth saw that it resisted somehow the erosive nature of water. It held with it an arcane hum. Anasa collected some barbs for the shopkeeper quest, as she was reminded by the voices in her head. They also found an audiolog, > “Oreleus returned after the attack yesterday. *cough cough* He said that those…things… wanted to get inside the vault. The men are rather spooked after seeing those strange creatures. *cough* But Oreleus has been installing a new arcanolock on the vault. He’s left these strange slates with the lieutenants, even given me one. *cough cough* Ugh. Although looking at the picture…I can’t help but see Alogar.”
## *Lo and Pradesh...*
They cracked open a chest and found two scrolls of *Lesser Restoration.* Down another set of stairs, they found a broken furnace and a skeleton with a bit of sheet metal where its ribs should've been. It held a slate depicting a mage-like figure with a hand pointed down to the ground, and a wand in the other. A strange arcane symbol sat above their head. He had a table of instruments by him. They listened to another audiolog, “Viggulum was right…there was no treasure…we were never guarding anything inside, we should’ve been guarding the outside from that thing in there… I should’ve…known…”
## *They reconvened where they all split...*
And then ventured back down. Eventually they found themselves before a magical vault of some kind. The kind they were warned about. On it there was another slate, on it a figure with a broken chariot, surrounded by others in chariots just like his thrown about. They found an inscription...
> “The foreign Emperor has been strung up by his feet. Death watches him from afar, standing in the shadow of the mage’s Tower. The Magician looks The Emperor in the eye, waiting for him to expire. The Tower splits the world in two and from its spire it can see the Chariots of war, torn asunder.”

At this point Hearth revealed they had the tower slate as well. They needed one more.
## *Lo and Anasa split up...*
And found 1400 copper

The party reconvened again and split again. Anasa and Pradesh found another audio log and the slate they were looking for, as well as 600 gp. “Disease has started leaking out of the vault. Approximately one third of our forces are starting to fall ill. I’ve asked our resident mage to reinforce the seal but High Mage Oreleus insists the seal will hold. I have to admit, I don’t trust ‘im. He’s the reason we had to seal that damn thing up in the first place.”
## *Lo and Hearth...*
Found two red potion bottles (one bigger than the other) and three scrolls one of which was a scroll of detect disease.
## Dungeon under Maz's Island
> 1400 cp
> 600 gp
> 2 Jade (50 gp each)
> 4 Amethyst (50 gp each)
> (- 2 amethysts given to hearth)
> 
> = 800 gp + 1,400 cp
> = 160 gp + 280 cp per person
> 
> And Hearth gets 2 amethysts for spellcraft
## *The party reconvened and took a short rest...*
After which they approached the vault with the slates. They put them in in what they believed to be the correct order (from left to right):

| Slate    | Orientation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Emperor  | down        |
| Magician | down        |
| Tower    | up          |
| Death    | up          |
| Chariot  | up          |

At first there was nothing, then a rumble started. The lattice structure around the sphere began winking out of existence, leaving only the opaque blue sphere. It cracked, and there was a plume of terrible murky water emerging from it. Slowly, the entire sphere disappated, and emerging from its own disgusting filth... A wastrilith!

After killing it, they explained their findings to Yamanu, who revealed a thinner figure--an individual of obsidian skin, eyes a brilliant yellow reflecting light off their own skin. They flashed a brilliant white smile. "My name is Yamanu, and I really appreciate this. Apologies for the deception, I'm not always greeted by such kindness." Lo offered them a spot in the crew and they seemed receptive. They'd seen the crown come up time and again, as it was important to the area. "If you're gonna go lookin' for it, I'd be happy to lend what knowledge I do have. And if the rest of my siblings," who they explained were separated recently by a storm, "I'm sure they've got more information for you too."
## *They boarded the Twilight Wanderer...*
Yamanu was particularly shiny in the sun, and he doffed his coat. During some conversation, it was revealed that Yamanu was seventeen years old, and could shapeshift very well, or at least change his height and some of his features.
