# Notes
Anasa predicted the weather and consulted Lo about her findings–pink mist weather. Lo gained information that was not her own through the power of her helm of telepathy (Helm of the Internet). Pink mist often accompanied an enchantment storm. It would take them about 3 days to travel from Vaton’s Bay to Avis Isle.

Hearth cast primal inheritance a few times, and about 6 hours into the voyage, the rain took on a pinkish hue. Soon enough, those on the deck got a case of the giggles and Hearth counteracted the effect by casting warding wind, clearing the rain. Anasa though was just personally able to resist it by being too anxious passively.

The next day, after weathering the storm, Kohgar seemed to be acting strange. He alerted the party to an invisible evil monster, they killed it, and that was that. It was probably related to the curse Eeriweth put on Pradesh.

Finally, after 3 days, they managed to get to Avis Isle. Lo had to telepathically signal to the legion to let her in. Talking with the legion, they learned that Governor Villanueva had been captured. After some back and forth, they led the party to the Saxe Fort to meet with some strategists who were working on three plans. Notably, the fort was missing the big node that was associated with the governor at Vaton’s Bay. 

Unfortunately, the crown wasn’t there.

Effectively, the fort had been converted into a refugee camp, tents strewn about. The people who lived on Avis Isle seemed primarily serpentine, with more humanoid bodies. They regarded the crew with some degree of suspicion. They were led into a room with the Felix Rangers, in the midst of a heated debate.

One voice, “I’m saying we should go rescue the ones captured. If we can liberate those in the second outpost, we can split their forces in half!”  
A dissenter, “I get that you’re young and you want to rescue the people, but we need to break the supply lines”

A third voice chimed in, “If we want to rescue the governor we should just go to where the governor is!”

There was a dwarf, a tall copper dragonborn, a gnomish woman with a green scarf and a violin, and a larger bronze dragonborn with a scar across her right eye.

- The [[Zenbis Jharthraxyn|bronze dragonborn]] and the [[Argiel|dwarf]] wanted to take out the supply stores.
- The [[Ufeli|gnome]] wanted to rescue the captured serpentfolk
- The [[Shakax|red dragonborn]] said they should just rescue the governor

During the discussion, it was mentioned that Felix, the namesake of the rangers was missing. He was in the infirmary and Hearth paid him a visit. Felix got downed by a poisonous mutant urchin and a weird shrimp thing. He healed him over the course of a few minutes, for which [[Felix]] thanked him.

In the end, Lo decided that the Rangers would head to the second encampment to rescue the serpentfolk, while the Jawbreakers would rescue the governor. They were looking for an individual with sun-kissed skin, blue scales, and braided black hair. Chikere Villanueva.

The parties then split, the dwarf gave the crew a map and a scroll of fireball.

The Jawbreakers made for the rear encampment…

The plan was that Hearth would take the scroll and set the ships on fire as a distraction before then heading back to the fortress to meet with the rest of the party. Pradesh and Kohgar meanwhile would distract the people at the base allowing Lo to try and magically suggest someone to free the governor, and if that failed she’d just kill whoever had the key and do it herself. That was the plan to rescue the governor.
