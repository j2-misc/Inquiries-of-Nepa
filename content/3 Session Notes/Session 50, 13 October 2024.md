# Notes
[[Algir]] welcomed the party to search where they liked, but noted they'd find most of the guilds ([[Quills of the Claw]], [[Sailor's Guild]]) on the Northwest end of town, most of the merchant shops just a little further in, and the craftsmen on the Northeast. [[Algir]] also recommended they speak to [[Branwen]] of [[Avis Stars]], as he'd be the one someone would pawn things off to. [[Pradesh]] asked about apothecaries and was pointed towards [[Sandra]] of [[Soluwo's Cauldron]] and [[Grazia]] of [[Syza Herbal Remedies]]. [[Algir]] ALSO pointed them to the Graveyard if they wanted to see [[Amos]] a worshipper of [[Setafroum, The Voracious Maw]].

- [[Hearth]] and [[Kall]] went to search for [[Milicent]] at the [[New Dawn Park]] and [[Falk]] at the shrines
- [[Lo]] and [[Yamanu]] went to speak with [[Guildmaster Suman]] and [[Guildmaster Merilyn]]
- [[Pradesh]], [[Anasa]], and [[Kohgar]] went to search the shops.
## Hearth and Kall
First they went to the Shrines to search for [[Falk]]. [[Kall]] leapt up superhumanly high to get a better look around, but this near immediately cleared the area of civilians. "I think I saw a shrine that way," he said.

"Nice jumping, maybe in a less crowded area next time, but you live and learn," [[Hearth]] said.

"They always tell me to be careful when I do that."

"I think city folk are just a little more sensitive to things they don't understand. You jumpin' really high in the air and creating a massive impact, me turnin' into animals."

"You can do that?"

"Yeah, everyone I knew could."

"I don't think I've ever met anyone who can do what I do the way I do."

"That just makes you a little more special now doesn't it? Cause I think I'm the last person who can do what I do." [[Hearth]] continued, "people might make you feel bad for doin' stuff that appears weird or a faux pas, but they never apologize for the weird stuff they do. It's not weird. It's just different."

Eventually, they made it to the shrine. They stood before a natural-seeming mound and an elderly [[Tortles|Tortle]] emerged from underneath it. [[Falk]] asked, "Why have you sought out an old man like me?"

[[Hearth]] told him of his story, that his family, the [[Tribe of Toten Fil]], was attacked and transmuted into strange monsters, and how in seeking vengeance, he killed the perpetrator, but let someone die who didn't need to, and now he was all that was left. "I'm lost, and I can't let go of this seed of anger in my heart."

[[Falk]] asked him who he was angry at, and why he was angry, and [[Hearth]] told him he held an almost directionless anger at the world for not understanding him. [[Falk]] asked [[Hearth]] if he was willing to help someone else understand, and he nodded. It would be a hard job.

[[Hearth]] asked the [[Tortles|Tortle]] about his kind, in the interest of finding out more about [[Kohgar]]. "There are many of my kind, though few wash ashore. There are only two of my circle, though we are not so similar to [[Tribe of Toten Fil|Toten Fil]]." He went on to explain that he was of the [[Circle of Am Li'aton]].
## Lo and Yamanu
They made their way toward the docks, and while it wasn't nearly as clamorous as [[Galo'tari]], it was much more familiar. [[Yamanu]] took on the appearance of a light-skinned, blonde human teenager. Lo spied two buildings, one very ornate with the bow of a ship sticking out of its front. Another, closer to the shoreline, was much wider and had a lighthouse sticking from its west-wing, and she could see the glint of some bit of metal from the central atrium. 

They headed to the building with the lighthouse first. It had a wooden sign out front that looked almost like paper, reading [[Quills of the Claw]]. Inside was bustling. [[Serpentfolk]] made their way around, many carrying large stacks of paper, some bound in scrolls. Lo walked up to one of the clerks at the front office. She was wearing a blue pin of a claw holding a scroll case. They asked to speak with [[Guildmaster Merilyn]], and were directed to the stairs. [[Yamanu]] commented they'd always wondered what all the fuss was about guilds. Regardless, they pressed on and found the source of the glint they'd spied before entering the building, a large telescope. The guildmaster was a bronze-skinned woman with her hair in a ponytail. They asked her about the mysterious artifact they were looking for. They were directed to [[Lachesis]] to learn more about the artifact, and [[Trinity]] to ask about suspicious individuals. [[Lachesis]] operated the only library in town, while [[Trinity]] ran the weapons shop, [[Sapphire Supplies]]. She also suggested they seek out [[Marie]] and [[Massimo]], "those two are always up to something." They both ran different brothels, [[Massimo]] on the north end; [[Marie]], south.

[[Guildmaster Merilyn|Merilyn]] then tried to overcharge [[Lo]] and [[Yamanu]] for a map of [[New Syza]], but they didn't bite.
## Anasa, Pradesh, and Kohgar
On the way over, [[Anasa]] noticed a blue door with a golden "V" on it. She pointed it out to [[Pradesh]] and they decided to check it out. [[Kohgar]] looked at them like they were fucking crazy, just completely bat nuts insane, so [[Pradesh]] remained outside with [[Kohgar]], and [[Anasa]] opened the door and stepped in. She found herself surrounded by the usual bits and bobs of [[Vexing Viktor's]], [[Morgana]] still at the desk.

[[Anasa]] turned in some of the items [[Viktor]] had asked her for in exchange for a discount (including a large amount of [[Celestial Essence]] taken from the [[Kuo-Toa]] on [[Vaton's Bay]] without their knowledge; [[Viktor's Discount Bounties]]). He also suggested they could source [[Psycho Silk]] from [[Phase Spiders]] on the [[Shattered Isle]]. 

Meanwhile, [[Kohgar]] and [[Pradesh]] got some stuff from a letherworker's shop. Then they tried to go find [[Lo]].
## Hearth and Kall
They were off to find [[Milicent]]. "I didn't know you'd lost so many," [[Kall]] said.

"I appreciate that," [[Hearth]] said. "I want to say it's okay, but it's not and it's gonna be a while before it is."

"I didn't know my folks a lot. Did you know yours?"

"In a way. It was a little more communal than here." He gestured to the homes surrounding them, "each family lives in their own home and are all closed off from each other. My people, we had no walls. Everything we did we did together."

"That's kind of like us."

"Yeah, that's family. It's not who you're related to or how long you've known someone. It's caring enough to give a helping hand." He asked, "How'd your siblings get all split up?"

"We were on a boat coming to this area, but there was a nasty storm and our boat sank."

"I'm sorry that happened."

"But it's good, cause [[Yamanu]]'s still here, and [[Algir]]'s here. I hope we find the rest. We're still missing some."

"They're probably on these next couple islands."

"Hopefully."

They found someone who looked like a [[Azure Legion|Legionnaire]], but lacked the distinct azure markings, playing some instrument. They could hear someone warming up their voice. It was [[Milicent]]. [[Hearth]] explained why [[Falk]] and [[Chikere Villanueva|Governor Villanueva]] sent him to her. She said the faith of the region was inconvenient to the [[Greater Filan Empire|Empire]], and that now it might be the only one left that owed allegiance to [[Zasorol]], "there are those still who follow him. We have not reclaimed the same notoriety, but we are not gone."

"How did you let go of the anger?"

"It is, I'll admit, difficult. Sometimes I think about what happened to all of us and it still turns me indignant. Instead, we have turned our attention away from revenge and turned it toward the work of rebuilding. There are those of us who claim to still follow him who have turned to anger, but in our case, we have found it to be far better to work on rebuilding ourselves. In your case, you may have to start first by rebuilding what your tribe was; teaching others. You'll be surprised to find just how many are interested in learning from you."

They talked some more, about whether or not all this was meant to happen, or what if they were to go back, but none of it mattered. [[Milicent]] said, "I could try to take those with the faith back, but what about those we have now? Who would care for them? I can't undo what's been done to us, but I can start something new."
## Lo and Yamanu
They made it to an acropolis type structure, a very neatly organized library. A [[Serpentfolk|Vos'skyriss]] woman greeted them. [[Lo]] asked her if she had any ideas what mystery headgear was stolen and she suggested it might be the [[Dragon's Helm]], a mix between a crown and a helmet. "The [[Azure Legion|Legion]] can be awfully cagey about the specifics about these sorts of artifacts. It's part of a set, but the common understanding is that the [[Dragon's Helm]] was supposed to be bequeathed to someone, but they never arrived. Thus it's been in [[Azure Legion|Legion]] hands ever since." There was little publicly available, and so she paid an entrance fee and the two found a place to sit and study. [[Yamanu]] found some books of his own, in order to research more about the [[Ifig Region]].

Additionally, the librarian gave them a specific text on the [[Dragon's Helm]] and [[Yamanu]] looked through it first. The account was authored by the [[Azure Legion]] itself. They found an article pertaining to the [[Dragon's Armor]], "Those bestowed by the rite to rule by the [[Azure Commander]] are given pieces of the [[Dragon's Armor]] as a symbol of their right to rule over the territories given to them. The set consisted of a [[Dragon's Helm|helm]], a breastplate, greaves, two gauntlets, and a shield." Lo recalled the armor pieces worn by the Governors.
- [[Chikere Villanueva|Villanueva]] wore a breastplate
- [[Nicola Favianus|Nicola]] wore a single gauntlet
- [[Governor Numitor]] always walked around with heavy bootsteps
The text also stated that the armor provided some vague magical protection, as well as a supernatural awareness. Lo experimented some with her telepathy and found that she could sense other nodes connected to [[Algir]], but couldn't connect to him directly like she could a typical big node. She figured she could connect to him if she was closer, even though she would be able to connect to someone like [[Chikere Villanueva|Villanueva]] from much further.

Lo requested the local [[Azure Legion|Legionnaires]] log all connections they make so she could view them later under the assumption that whoever stole the [[Dragon's Helm]] would at some point use it to connect to their network. The rest of their time, [[Yamanu]] read about the region and afterwards they headed out to look for someone who might know more about whoever stole the helm, or whoever knew more about [[The Undertow]].
## Pradesh, Kohgar, and Anasa
Met back up at [[Avis Stars]], the jewelry store. [[Algir]] had previously told them the shop's owner, [[Branwen]] would know if someone tried to pawn something off to him. He suggested some shifty individuals to look into:
- [[Nazario]], [[Essert & Sons]]
- [[Florence]], [[Scale & Leather]]
- [[Agosinto]], Manager at the [[New Syza Arena]]
They headed to [[Essert & Sons]] where [[Pradesh]] purchased an extendable ladder and a boarding plank which would be complete sooner rather than later.
