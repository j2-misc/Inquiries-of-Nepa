# Notes
The next morning, the party met at the *[[Monster and the Purse]]* tavern. [[Lo]] chose this one because it was a bit on the seedier end, and she didn't really know anyone who worked there save for the bartender *kinda*.

Lo had everyone sign a contract that boiled down to a 20% cut for everyone including the crew (any miscellaneous group expenses) of any liquid expenses, and a utilitarian split of any magic items. She commented on [[Anasa]]'s nice signature and this sparked a question or two about the crew's ages. They talked a bit about herbs and shit and [[Pradesh]] brought out some [[Shorestem]], which Lo was familiar with being used to prevent seasickness, dizziness, and confusion.
## *Then, the party split to get ready...*
Lo procured an old sloop from [[Rulfim|Rufim Ironseeker]]. In faded, flaking letters were the words *[[The Twilight Wanderer]]*. It was a fast ship, covering about 300 miles per day, and decently powerful. It had ballistae along its broadsides and a smaller mangonel at the bow. Lo paid 100 gold for supplies for it, taking up one of its two cargo slots.

Anasa bought some magic items from [[Vexing Viktor's]].
## *Once the party reconvened...*
Anasa presented Pradesh a needle with an [[Eldritch Claw Tattoo]]. She donned her own [[Necklace of Adaptation]]. She offered the [[Orb of Shielding (lightning and thunder)]] to [[Hearth]] or Lo, and Lo let Hearth have it. Hearth handed custom tailored hats to each member of the party. Then they all boarded, and they'd head to [[Maz's Island]].
## *The journey would take 4 days...*
On the second day, they entered the [[Ifig Region]].
## *On the third day, the 17th of Ivelon...*
The weather didn't seem that bad. The wind was calm, the skies were clear. Then she was thankful it was, because out on the distance, starboard, was an [[Greater Filan Empire|imperial scout]]. The frigate slowly began to turn in the party's general direction. They began to turn in the party's direction. There was some sort of signalman at the top. He was hailing them to stop. They'd be harassed.

The plan was to pretend to stop, and then sail full speed away before they could be caught. It was risky, but it was their best chance. As they got up close, they saw the dreaded imperial boarding plank. It was then that Lo and Hearth forced wind into their sails and full sailed away as fast they could. One managed to land on their deck, attacking Anasa, but they were quickly able to toss him overboard and sail away!
## *On the fourth day...*
Pradesh went all out on the crew's meals, preparing them well made individualized dishes. As Anasa was keeping lookout, a [[Koalinth|green skinned person]] emerged waving a bog green flag, hailing the party. They almost looked like an oceanic hitchiker. With three metal hooks, they pulled themselves aboard. The main figure said they were looking for a [[Sea Elves]] hawkin' goods.

"Twenty gold in it for ya, if you know where they went." But they didn't, so they earned no gold and were left alone after that. That guy for sure was shady as hell. Group'a thugs lookin' for a guy. Fucked up.
## *[[The Twilight Wanderer]] approached where they thought the island would be...*
It was around six o'clock. Then, after a moment, they saw a thousand glimmering pieces beneath them as they began to lose light. A marvelous glitter of shining bits; a mountain of silver, perhaps, on a slope that rose up to what seemed to be [[Maz's Island]]. They were in just the right place. Lo congratulated and thanked the crew, and she was about to dive down, but then there was a sudden beam of light illuminating the deck, and then another.

As the party squinted to see the source, they saw on either side, two sloops, and behind them was a frigate. It was not adorned in the red and gold of the empire, but a stark white with brilliant blue touches. The sloops were the same, obscured by strange light devices. There were almost humanoid figures. Coming into focus from aboard the frigate was a [[Nicola Favianus|halfling woman]], with brown hair tied into a knot. She wore heavy boots, a breastplate of the same stark white with blue accents. Her right hand was adorned in a similar gauntlet, more blue than white, radiating with some sort of power. "Who goes there?! And what business do you have on *my* island?!"
