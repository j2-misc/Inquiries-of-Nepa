# Notes
They approached the mid camp, seeing smoke and hearing combat in the distance. [[Chikere Villanueva|The sapphire dragon]] accompanying them readied themselves to engage. [[Kohgar]] immediately leapt into action, crashing through the walls into the camp. The [[Mutants|Mutant]] effort was already struggling. The fairest fight Kohgar could see was three-to-one in favor of the [[Azure Legion|Legionnaires]]. The citizenry had already fled. They saw [[Zenbis Jharthraxyn]]. [[Chikere Villanueva|Governor Villanueva]] said they'd mobilize the [[Azure Legion|Legionnaires]] against the [[Mutants]] soon enough.

They made their way back to the [[Saxe Fort]], passing recently freed citiziens (most [[Serpentfolk]], some [[Human]]). At the fort, the Governor shifted their form and took on a humanoid appearance. They asked to speak with both [[The Jawbreakers]] and [[The Felix Rangers]] the next day, until then, however, they had free rein of the place.
## *Lo explored around the fort...*
The courtyard had been converted into a refugee camp. Individual Legionnaires occasionally wandered through. Viewing the telepathic network, Lo observed that the smaller nodes seemed to be reporting to the large node ([[Chikere Villanueva|Governor Villanueva]]) which was now back at the fort.
## *Pradesh retired to one of the guest rooms...*
The rooms were not nearly as much in the military style as the [[Saxe Fort]] at [[Vaton's Bay]], but rather they appeared to be more like traditional guest rooms.
## *Anasa headed down to the beach...*
Her voices spoke to her. They commented they hadn't had much need to interject as of late, and the gruffer of the voices asked if she even knew what [[Skyris Poison]] was. She didn't. They commented that it's been some time since she'd been home.

"I don't know the meaning of the word."

"We all do. You just don't know how to recognize it."

Anasa asked about the place she saw in her vision some time ago, and the voices said it was home, "to all of us."

"I've never actually been there. Hard to call it home."

"You'll find it's home whether you like it to be or not."

Anasa said, "*Anasa* has never been there, but *I* have, haven't I?"

"That's one way of putting it."

They changed the subject back to [[Skyris Poison]]. The gruffer of the voices said that a Skyris was a type of [[Serpentfolk]], perhaps one of ones she just helped rescue.

Anasa asked the voices if they were similar to the ones other [[Shifters]] had, like [[Nana]]. They said she had a stronger connection than most, despite what her parents told her.
## *Hearth spoke with the Governor...*
He told them that he was the last of his people, the last of a genocide. He was trying to rebuild, and in his travels he learned some of what he was told was true wasn't true, and he wanted to ask them about dragons. He asked, "is it true that a mundane item left in a dragon's hoard for a period of time can become magical?"

"First," they started, "let me offer my condolences. Secondly, I think it would do you well to remain on [[Avis Isle]] for a while now. There's some people you might benefit from meeting with. Primarily, you'll want to meet with [[Milicent]]. I'll introduce you to someone who can help you find them. Additionally, I'd recommend you try and find [[Falk]]. I think you'll find that their words are helpful. When you meet them, explain to them what you've explained to me. I was not here for the worst of it, but they were. Thirdly," they extended their hand, asking for Hearth's. He gave his hand and they placed it against their breastplate. He felt a thrum of magic emanating from their heart. Then, they answered his question, "yes."

He held onto his [[Orb of Shielding (lightning and thunder)|Orb of Shielding]] and asked they hold onto his staff. "You realize it'll take some time?"

"I'm willing to wait however long it takes. I have nothing but time."
## *The next morning...*
Each awoke in their own room, guarded by a Legionnaire (faced away from them), and they were all invited to the banquet hall for breakfast. [[Felix]] was the first, followed by [[Lo]], [[Shakax]], [[Anasa]], the rest of [[The Felix Rangers]], [[Hearth]], [[Kohgar]], and [[Pradesh]]. Anasa asked for and was given a single jar of [[Chulu Jelly]]. Everyone was served a bowl of porridge.

[[Chikere Villanueva|Villanueva]] thanked the parties and offered them all room and board at [[The Blue Oasis]] in [[New Syza]]. "It's located on the north side of the island, it has a beautiful view, and the weather should be clear today."

Lo asked Villanueva if they or any of the other governors had heard report of a [[Operation Crown|black crown]]. They said they knew of a bit of headgear stolen from the [[Azure Legion|Legion]] recently, but [[Algir]] was handling that, a displaced person currently residing in [[New Syza]].
## *They returned to the ship...*
[[Yamanu]] was talking at [[Kall]]. They were talking about some recurring theme, and that if they could get to the bottom of it they could find out what happened to them. "Are you following what I'm saying?"

"Uh... I guess?"

The party set sail for the north end of the island. They saw the mass of jungle fade into an area of plains and hills further in. There were settlements, and farms. Then they saw a city, a vibrant area filled with people, and shops.
## *The harbor was quiet...*
This was very foreign to Lo. There were people quietly setting up shop for the morning, and there was even an occasional [[Sea Elves|teal-colored elf]]. Yamanu asked what they were doing, and Lo told them they were looking for a person named [[Algir]].

The party disembarked and continued into [[New Syza]]. No one approached them to even ask who they were or why they were here. A complete lack of bureaucracy. They asked someone for directions and found their way to [[The Blue Oasis]]. They each got separate rooms like bungalows (6 through 10), and stable a for Kohgar. Each of the keys had a palm tree design. They all decided to take advantage of some luxuries included with their stay.

- A half-elven man massaged Anasa
- A young woman prepared a mud bath for Hearth
- Lo headed to the sauna

*Everyone got 5 temp hp!*
## *Kohgar checked out the stables...*
He wandered in, thought it was nice. He started to walk out, but [[Pradesh]] stopped him. He thought to himself that it was nice, but did they really want to stay here? Pradesh seemed insistent so Kohgar turned around and nonchalantly started digging a hole.
## *Pradesh looked around for a hangover cure...*
He settled at the bar at the front of the inn, helped fix his headache, and soon the rest of the party reconvened with him there as well. It wasn't long then before [[The Felix Rangers]] arrived. They razzed each other a little, and when [[Anasa]] returned from her massage she said she'd never been alright until that day, as though a completely different person.

Pradesh commented on the absurdity of the legion for not even knowing what it was that was stolen from them, and Lo added that there were no records taken when they stepped into the harbor. [[Shakax|Shakax]] and Lo commiserated about that, as the rest of [[The Felix Rangers]] didn't seem to care. Lo mentioned that well-kept documents was the reason [[Galo'tari]] never had problems like the islands in the [[Ifig Region]]. [[Shakax]] mentioned that he was from [[the desert to the north of Galo'Tari]], which had recently been conquered by the [[Greater Filan Empire]]. They commented that they were putting up a good fight now, and with [[Operation Crown|the crown]] who knew how anything could shake out. [[Hearth]] then made a joke about how they could use the time to prepare for the next [[Roil Rumble]], and with that in combination with [[Lo]]'s earlier jokes at [[The Felix Rangers]]' expense, [[Zenbis Jharthraxyn|Zenbis]] asked if they wanted to go. [[Hearth]] challenged her to an arm wrestling competition. He needed to rely on magic to win, and even then things left off on a draw because [[Argiel]] intervened with some countermagic against [[Zenbis Jharthraxyn|Zenbis]]'s wishes.

They found that [[Algir]] was housed in the palace, another guest of [[Chikere Villanueva|Governor Villanueva]]. [[Yamanu]] mentioned that Algir might be one of the [[displaced siblings]].
## *They approached the palace...*
It didn't look so much like it was described, however. A Legionnaire directed them upstairs to find [[Algir]], and [[Yamanu]] commented that he always had an eye out for fixing things, "I hope he hasn't got *too* mixed up."

They stepped into the office and there was a gray figure with a green bit of coloration to their skin, and a bright smile. They had pupil-less eyes, with a piercing gaze. They wore a white blouse and a set of army-green trousers. A pair of goggles sat on their head. "[[Yamanu]]! [[Kall]]! God I'm so happy to see you both!"

He then informed them that they had an artifact stolen from them, "a ceremonial headpiece of the [[Azure Legion]]. We think it was stolen by [[The Undertow]]."

Yamanu said they could just wait on the ship while the party sorted the matter out, but Algir said he wouldn't be able to leave until the matter was sorted. He explained [[The Undertow]] was the local thieves' guild, which were surprisingly evasive of psychic detection. Typically they just fenced stolen goods, but this was the first time they ever stole anything from the palace.

If they'd check the ports, their best bet would be asking [[Guildmaster Merilyn]] of the [[Quills of the Claw]], the cartography guild, or [[Guildmaster Suman]] of the [[Sailor's Guild]].

They'd split up to investigate
- [[Yamanu]] and [[Kall]] to the shrines
- [[Hearth]] and [[Anasa]] to one of the Guildmasters
- [[Lo]] to the other
- and [[Pradesh]] would cover as much ground as he could in the shops

Hearth was also told that [[Milicent]] was at [[New Dawn Park]], and that [[Falk]] would be at one of the shrines.
