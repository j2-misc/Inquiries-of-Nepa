# Notes
*[[The Jawbreakers|Jawbreakers]],*

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to inform you of a dangerous bounty posted by the [[Coalition of Waquo|Maritime Coalition of Waquo]] I doubt any lesser adventurers would be able to fulfill. Though I prefer not to discuss too much of the details via letter, I will tell you now that it is an adventure likely into dangerous waters from which we may not return, should you choose to accept. I propose each of us receive a receive a rum-runner's split of any liquid earnings (that is twenty-five percent split among three people), with the remainder being attributed to a set of group funds dedicated to any group expenditures including but not limited to ship upkeep and additional hired hands.

Your aid would be a great boon. If you accept this offer, you may find me in [[Galo'tari]] in the [[Coalition of Waquo]] at \[address\].

Sincerely,
 *-- [[Lo]]*

The party found themselves on [[The Dawn Jester]], a rather cozy passenger ship, heading to [[Galo'tari]]. 
*[[Anasa]]* looked back toward [[Merodo]]. There were no swordsman guildhalls in the [[Coalition of Waquo|Coalition]]. She reflected on this.
*[[Hearth]]* considered the fact that [[Doten]] was the furthest anyone of his tribe had ever travelled, and now he was travelling even further.
*[[Pradesh]]* recalled how he reacted to [[Lo]]'s letter. He was excited to go on an adventure. The good ol' days, with Lo! But this time there was more than just Lo. [[Kohgar]]'s mere presence felt somewhat disruptive, and he found himself somewhat constantly concerned

A large warship sailed alongside them. The Waquoan navy.

Anasa noticed that in Lo's letter, she proposed a twenty-five percent share for three people each. She was concerned that perhaps Lo didn't want her to come (which was a correct assumption). She did a bit of fishing to get her mind off it and caught a [[nightswimmer]], a purple to black fish with scales which make resplendent jewelry. A jeweler purchased it for 20 gold.

Hearth decided to kill some time by hopping overboard and turning into a [[plesiosaurus]]. A literal sea monster. Anasa tried to calm everyone down by saying, "Don't worry, he's a [[Druid]]," but that isn't a particularly convincing argument. The escort ship was ready to attack but Anasa got him out of the water. The escort then told him to not do that, at least outside of a certain parameter of hours. Hearth sometimes ignored this warning, and exactly once as he entered the water he was almost spotted, but he was safe.
## *Eventually, they landed on [[Galo'tari]]...*
As they disembarked, a restless murmur passed through the crowd. The wind carried bad news as easily as it carried salt. The party's first stop was a bakery, [[Bol Bread|BOL-BREAD]]. It didn't have a proper entrance, instead the entrance was a half-door with an outcropping of wood, and on the outside was a listing of the goods they sold. Inside was a family of [[Orcs|half-orcs]] kneading dough.

They ordered three honeydobs, a bread of a five inch diameter, with a braided crust, infused with honey. Pradesh bought a cookie pack and a horse bread for Kohgar, and a Bol Pearl (a spherical loaf of bread enough for a family of four) for the party. While making light conversation with the baker, he mentioned the [[Waquoan Navy|navy]]'s bounty: [[Operation Crown]] or something and pointed them in the direction of a poster. "Lookin' for any sellsword interested. They've been having public forums on the docks for maybe two weeks or so?"

Pradesh then found an apothecary to buy some **[[Shore Stem]]** (8 sp per dose), and then tested a potion that let him travel back to a place he'd been to, or at least let his mind roam there. He couldn't hear there, but he could see. This was at least mostly intended (basically, a potion of scrying).
## *The party then found their way Lo's house...*
Located in a  somewhat run-down neighborhood on the outskirts of town. [[Quanog|Her father]] opened the door. He had fading black hair, and the same stark yellow eyes as his daughter. He was missing part of his leg, and walked with a cane. He greeted them, recognizing they were the folks Lo travelled with. They gifted him the bread, and he was always happy to have some of Fabian's baked goods. They shared introductions, and he wished his condolences to Hearth, saying they were no strangers to loss around here. Kohgar offered him a cookie and he had half, though his doctor told him he shouldn't have too many.

It was a fairly dim home. The windows they did have were shuttered. The kitchen table seated two people, but seemed to have lacked use of late. There was a small bookshelf. It was a lonely space. The party settled down. Anasa asked how the war was going, and Quanog explained the [[Greater Filan Empire|Empire]] was getting a bit more confident in the winter following the off season. Not a lot of ships came back from the last battle, lost a lot of cavalry, too. The [[The Jawbreakers|Jawbreakers]] explained their adventure, and he looked intently at Hearth. It was a look of recognition. "We couldn't have done it without Lo."

"Yeah, she was always good with a weapon. Caught on quick. Quicker than I thought she would. Always wanted to do something. Something big. Even when she wasn't supposed to. Hope she didn't give you too much trouble." He paused, "I don't think she was really meant for all the strictness that comes with servin'. She really lives for the fight. Really in her element there. So if she's goin' out with y'all, I'm sure she'll find her spot, even if it takes her some time. That's really been my biggest worry. Hoping she finds her rhythm, her own little cove. But uh... Children. What're you gonna do, right? Can't force 'em to be like you. All you give 'em is the start and they'll make their own way."

Eventually, popping up behind Kohgar was a reasonably plump orange cat. "[[Hildo]], get down from there. Come on, c'mere," and the cat rested with him. Hildo was the cat he got to keep him company while Lo was gone. He already fell asleep laying with Quanog.

Eventually, Lo returned home. She and her father exchanged looks, and left with the party to attend a forum about Operation Crown. The party told Lo what they were up to in the meantime, and this prompted her to ask if they were sure they wanted to do *this* with all of *that* going on still.
## *There at the docks was a raised platform...*
It was a gallows repurposed as an orator's platform. In the crowd was the [[The Felix Rangers]], the same group the Jawbreakers faced in the first round of the [[Roil Rumble]]. Basically, they were looking for a [[Operation Crown|black crown]] belonging to an ancient [[Lagawu|Lagawan]] king. They were provided a depiction of the relic, a series of black rhombuses in a diamond shape along a singular black steel headband. It was a very plain design. "This relic is said to have been lost to a great monster in the [[Ifig Region]]." They would be rewarded a thousand platinum a piece on a successful return. Most of the party was dumbfounded at the sheer value of the reward.

Then, a spell went off from behind them, accompanied by a voice, "It's a shame you won't be able to get your hands on it, though!" An entire ship emerged from invisibility. A familiar ship, belonging to the Bloody Sails. Standing at the bow was one Isla Kevorkian, resting her wrists on her rapier stabbed into the edge. "I take it that your coalition is desperate to find this relic, and you'll offer even a pardon? For certain folks?"

The admiral, pinching the bridge of her nose, "... Yes, Kevorkian. If you can somehow survive the excursion. Your lot may be pardoned."

"Were you just there the whole time?"
"Just arrived, actually. Right on time." She proceeded to taunt the party, mocking their lack of ship and then they fucked off. Lo then made an arrangement with the Felix Rangers, that if they helped them kill the Bloody Sails they didn't care about the reward.

Lo then led the party to her contact when asked about whether or not they actually had a ship.
## *Stuck between two larger shops...*
Was a hole in the wall looking place with a nicely decorated sign just above it. With swirling letters colored like the night sky, "Vexing Viktor's"
## *Lo continued to lead them on to a small home...*
The residence of an older albino half-orc, [[Rulfim]].

She'd part with the ship, but she needed a favor first. Rumor had it that imperial spies were taking away children in the night at the [[Senthead District]]. It didn't sound like imperials to her, and she wanted Lo to check it out and take care of it. In exchange, they'd receive the Twilight Wanderer. They were to find a woman named [[Ruti]] who recently lost her child.

Hearth then made a stop at a tailor, "[[The Patient Path]]," to purchase some tricorne hats. Pradesh and Kohgar ventured elsewhere per Kohgar's request, leaving Lo and Anasa as the only ones left to go investigate the Senthead district. They asked around for Ruti and found their way to her house, guarded by a large half-orc. As they entered, they heard the inconsolable sounds of sobbing. As they made their way toward it, they saw a dent in the wall where an adult must've slammed into it with their whole body. She said there was a hulking figure in the doorway that batted her away like she was nothing and made off with her child in an unknown direction in the night. Anasa was able to narrow it down to likely a [[Hag]], [[Oni]], or a [[Troll]], though none were particularly common in this region.
## *Pradesh and Kohgar, meanwhile...*
Made their way to **[[Vexing Viktor's]].** A pale man, [[Viktor]], directed them to [[Morgana]], a corpse white woman with black hair tied back with an elegant clip. They sold magic items there. They purchased a [[candle of the deep]].
## *Anasa and Lo...*
Found that none of the crops seem to have been disturbed, or ran through. Perhaps the monster could fly, or teleport? Additionally, they all heard Ruti's screams, but saw no one, nor heard any children. The party reunited, Kohgar gave his candle to Anasa, and Lo updated the party on the fact they were likely to fight a hag. Kohgar began to stalk off after a scent, finding a pair of well-worn boots caked in mud, worn by Asunur, the orc who Anasa and Lo saw guarding Ruti's house earlier. The one night he didn't stand guard, was the night it happened. He made a promise to her late husband whom he served with in the war years ago when he passed. He wore a large cloak and a sizeable glaive. He suggested they split into pairs to search; Anasa and Asunur in the north fields, Lo and Hearth in the middle, and Pradesh and Kohgar in the south.
## *The others continued to stalk about, looking for the witch's hut...*
Whether or not it was real, or Anasa's fate, remained another Inquiry of [[Nepa]].
