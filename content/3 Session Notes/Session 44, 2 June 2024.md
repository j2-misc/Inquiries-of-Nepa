# Notes
Kohgar was brought before a Kuo-Toa with a large headdress. Fio presented him like a gift; a creature of the sea. The Kuo-Toa murmured that he was of low stock, foreign mud.

Cut back to the party. They arrived at the Ziggurat. Lo noticed that the stairs had orcish figures depicting them locked in combat against unrecognizable monsters. Ahead of them were these almost humanoid avian freaks. Lo and Pradesh approached cautiously like diplomats, while Anasa remained back with a hidden arrow. Hearth peered around the building's exterior, but the light rain provided a cover beyond which he didn't notice any spies.

Approaching the birds, one screeched and then addressed her somewhat hostilely. Approaching then was a similarly half-humanoid shark. After a fight, they took one captive and asked him questions. He'd only seen Azure Legion, and he told them that he made a deal for power with "Him", which was why he was a wereshark now. Then, he turned himself into a regular shark and started suffocating. Eventually, they killed him.
## *Back to Kohgar...*
Kavita asked, "So... what are we supposed to do with this thing now?"
Ishkur said, "We can use him as a bargaining chip."
Kavita asked why Fio offered him to the priest, "Professional courtesy," she said
"We don't have to be so polite, you know," said Kavita.
Isla then approached. "Seems our benefactors are in a bit of a bind."
"The jawbreakers?"
"Mhm. Our opportunity here is waning."
"I say we take 'em!" said Kavita.
"No. We're outnumbered as is." Then, her eyes settled on Kohgar, "I think I have an idea."
## *Back to the party...*
Anasa pried a bronze ring with green inlays off the wereshark (Ring of Jumpin). Anasa also found a broken crablike statue knocked over by signs of a struggle. Then she also noticed a painting on a pot depicting people looking up in awe. Past some curtains, Lo and Pradesh examined some walls. Lo could discern it was all very chaotic, definitely not orcish. Pradesh, however, picked up on a pattern of madness. Not glorifying it, but pointing it out as is, that sanity is lost. It seemed like a warning.

Then, they fought so many fucking weregulls, and rested after killing 'em all.

Afterwards, Lo and Pradesh investigated a room with these large openings which sunk down below a large amount of water. She found then some bedding and a chest. They were bedrooms. Anasa had separately found an armory which was largely complete. On the next floor, there was another ascending staircase and they were surrounded by rubble and some sort of dormant, thrumming energy. There were some more were monsters there and Anasa threatened to eat the weregull to convince it to talk. He said that they just kicked out the Kuo-Toa because they wanted the place. Eventually he admitted they were trying to get the legion off the island. He said that it didn't have anything to do with the Bloody Sails, but it definitely did. Apparently the Sails then told the Kuo-Toa that the Legion kicked them out. He also told them that they were interrogating a guy upstairs, the guest that went with the Legion three days ago.
