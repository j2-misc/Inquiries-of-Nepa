Welcome to the Nepa Wiki.
# Organization
## Folders
- **Images** -> A directory that is invisible on the wiki that houses images used in articles.
- **Characters** -> profiles on #PCs and significant #NPCs.
- **World** -> details about the world, such as flora, fauna, factions, places, and the like.
- **Session Notes** -> individual notes for each session.
## Tags
Tags are another way to organize articles besides just folders. They help with categorization and searching for things later.
